# CS-Final
⭐Recreation of Pong with customizable difficulty AI.

There are a few things you might need to know before playing the game.

This game is my version of Pong and it might be a bit different from your typical Pong.

When you first open the game you can choose between a difficulty of Normal or Hard.

The difference between Normal and Hard is that the AI can move further towards the ball in Hard.

When you enter the game your difficulty as well as your score is shown below the board.

Use the "W" key to move your paddle up and the "S" key to move your paddle down.

Have fun!
